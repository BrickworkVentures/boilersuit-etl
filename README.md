Boilersuit ETL - Extract, Transform, Obfuscate and Load Test data

# Overview

## Copy Tables from Different DB Systems
A few lines of code will copy table structures and data from various sources into 
your target DB system. You can use any JDBC connection as source or target, or use 
the built-in `executeQueryDumpFile` parameter, which will have Boilersuit ETL 
write into a textfile instead of an actual running DB instance:

## Obfuscate
To obfuscate data, sanitizers can be defined. Any value inserted into target will be replaced by 
values generated by the configured `ValueSanitizer`. They will respect types, e.g. String-like attributes
will turn into random hash codes, Number-like attributes will turn into numbers: 
![Alt text](src/docs/img/example2.png?raw=true "Example 2")

There are a range of ValueSanitizers available, some simple, some more sophisticated - check below.

## Cross-DB Querying
Queries accross DBs are not per se possible, but since results obtained from DB are stored as Java
objects, we can solve things in a very basic way as shown in the following sample cases.

### Join entries from other DBs

Assume you want to load only T1 (in MSSQL) entries for names that are contained in T2 (Postgres):

```java
final Result t1Entries = mssqlSource.query("SELECT * FROM T1");  // { "joe", 50000 }, { "bob", 60000 }, ...
final Set relevantName = t1Entries.getColumnValues("name");  // { "joe", "bob" } 
final Result relevantT2Entries = pgSource.query("SELECT * FROM T2" + pgSource.wherePropertyIn("name", relevantNames));
target.insert(relevantT2Entries);
```

# Sanitize
To obfuscate data, a range of ValueSanitizers are available. The following picture gives an overview;
